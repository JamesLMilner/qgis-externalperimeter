# QGIS - External Facing Perimeter

    2. Go to the 'Processing' tab and click 'Toolbox'
    3. A panel will appear in the left hand side; click Scripts > Tools > 'Add script from file'
    5. The script will appear under 'User scripts' in the same panel
    6. Open script
    7. Select your building dataset
    8. Run!
