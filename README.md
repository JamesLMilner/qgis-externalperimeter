# QGIS - External Facing Perimeter

## Introduction
This QGIS script will determine the external facing perimeter of buildings. It appends the perimeter for each building into a new field called 'ext_peri'. Buildings must be in Lines to function correctly. You can use the Polygon to Line tool to achieve this if you have buildings as Polygons.

    1. Open QGIS
    2. Go to the 'Processing' tab and click 'Toolbox'
    3. A panel will appear in the left hand side; click Scripts > Tools > 'Add script from file'
    5. The script will appear under 'User scripts' in the same panel
    6. Open script
    7. Select your building dataset
    8. Run!

## Compatibility
